2. multidomain class:
-- calc_kC_conn: Fixed issue with random panel order for the TSL connection type

====================================================================================================

DEV:
1. multidomain class:
-- plot:
----- Added options to only compute (and return) results without plotting them
----- Added functionality to pass precalculated results to just plot them vs having to recalculate them every time the plot function is called. 
----- Created a common colourbar for all panel groups (using the prev dev)
----- Cleaned up the code to calculate results 
----- Modified plotting code (visual changes, added tick for 0)

2. multidomain class:
-- calc_results (added)

3. test_dcb_before_opening and _tsl:
----- Can now switch between 2+ panels per level (experimental - to check if the TSL works)

====================================================================================================

KNOWN ISSUES:
1. DCB deform downwards upon applying an upward displacement 
2. Structure consisting of 2 and 3 panels have (slightly) different results

DEV: Calc damaged stiffness + TSL penalty stiff matrix

1. kCSB (added):
-- Calculates penalty stiffness matrix for the damaged region with traction separation law by integrating over the concerned region

2. penalties:
-- Calculation of the out-of-plane stiffness per integration point across the entire contact interface
---- Considers damaged stiffness

25-03-24 onwards:

BUG: Fixed updating kCSB_dmg per NR iteration (solved interpenetration problem)

1. test_dcb_damage:
-- Fixed issue of stiffness bands (bec of high penalty stiffness) from not moving as damage front moves

2. multidomain.py class:
-- get_kC_conn:
---- Removed option to skip function when kC_conn exists (it was skipping it for each NR iteration so kCSB_dmg was not updated after the first iteration of the first load step)

3. penalties.py:
-- Added filter mask to prevent k_i and k_dmg from being added when penetration between bodies occurs

12-04-24 commit:

DEV: Force calculation (BUGS EXIST!!)

1. multidomain.py:
-- force_out_plane:
---- Implemented 3 different methods to calculate the out of plane force (applied load) 
------ Line integral of Qx along the edge of the top plate (where the load is applied)
------ Area integral of q over the whole plate/s (comes from the equilibirum equations)
------ Von-Karmans non linear equations (from CK's and J.N.Reddy's books) to find pz which is then integrated over an area or line (using dirac delta)

-- Only the first implementation is reliable - rest unsure

2. legendre_gauss_quadrature.cpp:
-- Added gauss points and weights for numerical integration till 304

3. test_dcb_before_opening_tsl.py:
-- Added function that is just a beam bending of a single arm of the DCB
   The shell is split up into two subpanels.

DEV: Added sigmoid ftn for translation terms

19-05-24 commit:

1. bardell_functions.cpp:
-- The first and thrid bardell terms are modified to now include sigmoid functions (a,b = -+15, c2=0)
Not all ftns updated. Only vec_f and vec_fp updated with the new sigmoid definitions. The other ftns have the older bardell functions. 

2. multidomain.py:
-- BUG FIX: Tracking previous damage was causing the solution of the first NR iteration to be taken as the baseline which was wrong. Corrected it to take the covnered NR solution as the damage of the previous loading step

3. test_dcb_before_opening_tsl.py:
-- Added 'test_leg_sig' and 'plot_test_leg_sigm' to fit the currently used shape functions to the sigmoid functions. Aimed at seeing if the currently used shape functions (bardell) can predict what is required. 

4. bardell_sigmoid.py: (in \theory\func)
-- Symbolic differentiation of sigmoid functions

DEV: family of sigmoid ftns; manually setting negative dipl = 0

01-06-24 commit:

1. bardell_functions.cpp:

	In essense, bardell is still being used
	
2. multidomain class:
-- calc_k_dmg:
---- Manually setting all displ after the first negative displ from the opening end to be zero

3. test_dcb_before_opening_tsl:

---- Code for 4 panels implemented

commit on: 30-06-24


1. multidomain.py 
-- force_out_plane_daamage :

-- calc_KT: 
---- Attemped parallelizing but doesnt work as some shell objs cant be pickled

-- calc_fext_dmg:
---- Calc fext term that is used as a connection instead of kSB_conn - doesnt work as intended

---- Calc traction when SB conn is used

-- calc_traction:
---- Calc traction for fext_dmg (when no SB conn is used)

-- calc_energy_dissipation:
---- Calculates energy dissipation per displacement increment from the traction separation curve

---- Parallelized it to have multiple runs in parallel for the cluster - support to generate pool arguments

8. test_dcb_damage_support_and_fext.py
-- Stuff that was oriignally in test_dcb_damage is now moved here
-- Includes:
---- test_dcb_damage_prop_fext_conn (using a connecting force at the interface rather than the kSB_conn
